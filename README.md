# Job Recommendation System

Welcome to the Job Recommendation System project! This system utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to provide personalized job recommendations based on job titles and descriptions. Whether you're a job seeker looking for relevant positions or a recruiter aiming to streamline candidate searches, this system is designed to enhance your experience.

## Features

- **Text Processing:** Implemented advanced text processing techniques, including tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization, to extract meaningful information from job titles and descriptions.

- **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Utilized TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to convert textual data into numerical vectors, capturing the importance of words in the context of the entire dataset.

- **Cosine Similarity:** Employed cosine similarity to measure the similarity between job listings, allowing for accurate recommendations based on the content of job titles and descriptions.
